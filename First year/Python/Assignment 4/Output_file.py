The solution of Question 1 is:

Number of discs: 3

A is the initial rod
B is the extra rod
C is the final rod

Steps:
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 2 from rod A to rod B
Move disk 1 from rod C to rod B
Move disk 3 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod B to rod A
Move disk 2 from rod B to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C

Number of steps will be: 7

The solution of Question 2 is:

Enter the number of rows you want to print: 4
The Pascal's Triangle using recursion is:
   1 
  1 1 
 1 2 1 
1 3 3 1 
The Pascal's Triangle using iteration is:
   1 
  1 1 
 1 2 1 
1 3 3 1 

The solution of Question 3 is:

Enter first integer value(dividend): 174
Enter second integer value(divisor): 23

Quotient: 7 
Remainder: 13

a. Check whether the function (divmod()) is callable or not:
True, which means it is callable

b. Check whether all the values are zero or not:
All values in result(i.e. quotient and remainder) are non-zero.

c. Add (4,5,6) to the result and filter out values greater than 4:
Values greater than 4(in list format) are: [5, 6, 7, 13]

d. Convert the above result into a set datatype:
The output of previous part in set datatype would be: {13, 5, 6, 7}

e. Make the set immutable:
The immutable set would be: frozenset({13, 5, 6, 7})

f. Evaluate the maximum value from the set and find out its hash value:
The maximum value from the set is: 13
The hash value of 13(considering it to be integer) is 13 and its hash value is 3246547584827891348(if we consider 13 as a string).

The solution of Question 4 is:

Enter name of student: Soumil Arora
Enter SID of Soumil Arora: 21105005
Object Created

The name of the student is Soumil Arora and his/her roll number is 21105005

Object destroyed

The solution of Question 5 is:

The current database is:

a. Updated the salary of Mehak from 40000 to 70000

b. Deleted the record of Viren(whose salary is 60000)

The final database is:
Mehak has a salary of 70000 rupees
Ashok has a salary of 50000 rupees
